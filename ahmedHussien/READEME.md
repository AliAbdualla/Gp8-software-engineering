How the Game Works:

    Objective: The goal is to click the "Click Me!" button as many times as possible within 10 seconds.
    Score: Each time the button is clicked, the score increases by 1.
    Timer: The game starts immediately, and the timer counts down from 10 seconds.
    End of Game: Once the time runs out, the button is disabled, and the final score is displayed.

This is a straightforward game that you can expand on with additional features like levels, more complex scoring systems, or a high-score table.
